![3D website demo](docs/hero.gif)

A demo for showcasing a 3D website generated using displacement offset - enabling immersive 3D-style parallax effects by combining color images with depth estimation and view shifting.

ðŸ§© Features
*	Create subtle camera-shifted parallax layers.
* Scroll and mouse-based displacement offset
*	Sample project with HTML/JS demo

# Quick start
Statically host the root folder (Five Server in VS Code works well).  

Or if you prefer the command line:
```bash
npx http-server . 
```

That's it!
